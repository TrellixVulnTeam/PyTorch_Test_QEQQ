# PyTorch_Test
**The main role of the project:**
- PyTorch's usage
- FiftyOne's usage
- ONNX's usage
- ONNX Runtime's usage
- OpenMMLab's usage

**Note:**
- support platform: linux, windows
- it is recommended to install Anaconda
- when executing the test program, you need to locate the terminal to the directory where the python file is currently executed

**Test code:**
- PyTorch code
	- batch normalization
	- Faster R-CNN + ResNet-50 target detection
	- AlexNet image classification
	- digital identification: LeNet-5(train and predict)
- ONNX/ONNX Runtime code
	- ResNet-50 image classification
	- LeNet-5 digital identification
